This guide will talk about all the possible bans that you can get and how you can get them while using Steam. This guide will reference the Steam Support articles throughout the text as well.

[i]Take note that this guide will only explain bans that can be received through violations of Steam's guidelines.[/i] Some of the account restrictions that affect new Steam users are a part of your account status â€” limited accounts, for example, are restricted right after the registration until you spend $5 in the Steam Store.
