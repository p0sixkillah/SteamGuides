[previewimg=9122094;sizeOriginal,floatRight;envelope.png][/previewimg]Violation of the global forum [b]Rules and Guidelines[/b], as well as the local ones, is punishable with a ban. Both temporary and permanent bans in a community hub will result in a banned user not being able to participate in any of the discussions of the said community hub. This ban, however, affects only the community hub where a violation has been committed — the user is still free to post in discussions of other community hubs and the official Steam forums.
