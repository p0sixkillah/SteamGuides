This can happen, for example, when the CD Key is intended for a limited time activation, like a Beta, or if the publisher determines that the CD Key itself had been obtained by fraudulent means. 

The official Steam Support article states that [i]“Your account will not be restricted; however, the CD Key you received will be removed”[/i]. So, users do not need to worry when they see this notification:
