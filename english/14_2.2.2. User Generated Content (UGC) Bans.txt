In the case that a UGC violates Steam Rules and Guidelines, it can be banned by a Steam Community Moderator or Steam Support Staff.

Thanks to Steam Reviews, a potential buyer can now make a better decision when purchasing a product on Steam by getting to know another user's experience; having the ability to discover the positive and negative features of a game. In some cases, a review can be offensive or otherwise inappropriate. Such review will be banned and the following message will appear:
