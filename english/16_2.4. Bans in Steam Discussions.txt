[previewimg=10394799;sizeThumb,floatLeft;discussions_user_banned_pic.png][/previewimg]Violation of the Steam Discussions Rules and Guidelines will result in a ban from Steam Discussions. This ban, temporary or permanent, makes all Steam forums unavailable to the banned user. They can still participate in a community hub's discussions, however.

[previewimg=9123218;sizeOriginal,floatRight;discussions_comm_moder_mess_notif.png][/previewimg] If a user is banned, they will receive a corresponding notification. A new link, “Community Moderation Messages”, will also appear beneath “Post History”. This is the [b][i]only[/i] place[/b] where a banned user [b][i]can[/i][/b] discuss a moderator's actions and appeal to shorten the duration of their ban, or to lift it all together.

This is what they will see by going to the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/my/moderatormessages/]“Community Moderation Messages”[/url] page:
